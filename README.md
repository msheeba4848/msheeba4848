<h2> Quick ASAP facts : Non-Academic Edition </h2>

1. Having done my undergraduate in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, I said no to a invesment banking job after graduate since I loved working with data so much, I saw myself long term to be within the empatheic data usage space. That was my biggest opportunity cost (yet!)
2. I have a collection of 30+ plants with me and I absolutly adore them [img]
3. I ran an animal NGO in India with a couple of friends called PetsforHyd [link]
